                My name is Thaís and I live in Philadelphia, PA, which is far away from where I grew up. I'm from Brazil, from a small capital called João Pessoa, with a population of 800.000 people. I moved to Philly 3 years ago, because of my husband's job.

                Despite having more than 14 years of experience in textual production for online and offline media, being specialist in Digital Journalism, with emphasis on content for Digital Media I have always had a foothold in technology, working for a Web Development Company in Brazil and managing the Website Creation Team. I have also written many articles in this field and did the layout for newspapers, magazines, created blogs and websites using Wordpress, played around with HTML, design and web content creation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                After nearly 3 years living in the United States and breathing technology everywhere, I decided to take on my passion for code and design and start a new career. Instead of writing texts, now I'm writing code.

            <p class="text">
                My first step was studying at The New York Code + Design, where I had great and intense learning. And the moment where I really felt as a developer was once I was taking a shower and just found the solution for the code that wasn't working. And that's just the beginning. I have so much to contribute in this field! Count on me!

            <p class="text"> 
                If there is one thing that I am proud of is the achievements I have made in the way. One of them is the award for the article "The Northeast of the future", awarded in the category of Media - Regional II. Published in issue 42 of the Revista Nordeste, the special report brought the view of specialists on trends and the main projections for the northeastern region in several segments and counted on other journalists in the team. In this report I showed what to expect of the technology in Brazil for the following years.
